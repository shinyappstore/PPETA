# PPETA: Preliminary Patient Dosing Education Tool

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/PPETA](https://shinyappstore.com/a/PPETA)__

PPETA is an application designed as a Preliminary Patient Education Tool. It incorporates a one-compartment first-order absorption pharmacokinetic model, where the concentration versus time profile is visually represented by a solid red line. The application introduces hypothetical therapeutic windows, illustrated by black horizontal dashed lines, defining the range of drug effectiveness (below 2.5 mg/L) to toxicity (above 5 mg/L). When initiating PPETA, the default setting for "Dose Frequency" is once daily, and the output plot displays the concentration-time profile for a hypothetical drug over a 10-day period (10 doses). Users can dynamically interact with the plot by adjusting inputs, observing real-time updates. Additionally, PPETA includes checkboxes for "missed dose" and "double dose," providing specific information about doses within the regimen. This app is part of a demonstration published: J Wojciechowski et al. CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol. 2015 Mar; 4(3): e00021.
